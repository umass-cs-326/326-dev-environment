# Lecture 06: Nested Models & More Data Types

## COMPSCI 326 Web Programming

## TODAY

We have covered lots. But, there is still more to learn about APIs. What we need to do is cover all ways in which we can send data to an API. In doing this, we will be able to build the backend part of a full stack web application such that it can handle all the different types of data that a frontend might send.

- Raw HTTP Request & Response
- HTTP Body - Nested Models
- Request Example Data
- More Data Types
- Cookie Parameters
- Header Parameters
- Response Model
- Response Status Code
