## 8. What Are Cookies?

A cookie is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server. Cookies are used for various purposes, such as:

- **Session Management**: Cookies can store session identifiers, allowing users to remain logged in as they navigate a website.
- **Personalization**: Cookies can store user preferences, such as language settings or theme choices.
- **Tracking**: Cookies can track user behavior across sessions and websites for analytics and advertising purposes
- **State Management**: Cookies can help maintain stateful information in stateless HTTP protocols.
- **Authentication**: Cookies can store authentication tokens to verify user identity.
- **Shopping Carts**: Cookies can keep track of items in a user's shopping cart on e-commerce sites.

At the end of the day, cookies are simply another form of data that can be sent to and from an API just like path parameters, query parameters, headers, and request bodies.
